# Code for personal homepage

This is the source code for my personal website (https://luerig.net) built with jekyll and the jekyll-klise theme, and served through Netlify [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/aea1c3d2-eec9-4522-be1d-53760b24159e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/luerig/deploys). More details on how the site was built can be found at https://luerig.net/posts/website-with-gh-pages.

You are welcome to use the materials presented here as inspiration for your own website, but please make sure to remove all content that is related to myself (particularly, check the assets, pages and posts folder).
