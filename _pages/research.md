## my research goals

As an evolutionary ecologist, my goal is to improve our quantitative understanding of the origin and maintenance of phenotypic diversity across various biological levels. My work not only addresses fundamental questions in phenotypic evolution, but also advances methodological frameworks for high-throughput phenotyping. Specifically, I use and develop computational tools and pipelines that make use of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) to extract high-dimensional phenotypic data. I have applied these methods across diverse biological systems, including crustaceans, insects, and aquatic plants, using both field and laboratory settings as well as natural history collections to study ecological and evolutionary processes.
