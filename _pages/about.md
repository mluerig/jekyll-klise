> Postdocs (since 2020)

I am currently based at Lund University in Southern Sweden in <a id="link" href="https://portal.research.lu.se/en/organisations/evolution-and-ecology-of-phenotypes-in-nature" target="_blank">Erik Svensson's lab</a>. My work is funded for a total of three and a half years by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) through an Early Postdoc.mobility fellowship and by the European Commission through a Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship. Before coming to Lund I worked as a short term (0.5 year) postdoc in Ole Seehausen's lab at Eawag Kastanienbaum, where I supported investigations of the evolutionary past of Lake Victoria Cichlids.

> PhD (2015 - 2019)

I completed my PhD in Blake Matthews' lab at Eawag Kastanienbaum under co-supervision from Jukka Jokela, funded by ETH Zürich's <a id="link" href="https://adaptation.ethz.ch/" target="_blank"> Center for Adaptation to a Changing Environment</a>. For my thesis, I conducted a series of experiments to explore the role of different types of species interactions within different levels of ecological organization and across a range of ecological contexts. An electronic copy of my thesis can be downloaded <a id="link" href="https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/eawag/islandora/object/eawag%3A19819" target="_blank"> here </a>. 

> Undergrad (2006 - 2015)

I received both of my undergrad degrees from the University of Oldenburg, where I was based at the Institute for Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment (<a id="link" href="https://uol.de/icbm" target="_blank">ICBM</a>). I did my Bachelors thesis at the <a id="link" href="https://www.leibniz-zmt.de/de/tropenforschung/organisation/wissenschaftliche-abteilungen-struktur/oekologie/ag-experimentelle-aquakultur.html" target="_blank">Kunzmann lab</a>  at the Center for Tropical Marine Ecology in Bremen, Germany, where I investigated the effect of multiple stressors on scleractinian corals. I then went abroad abroad to California for my Masters thesis, to investigate coexistence patterns of seasgrass mesograzers at the <a id="link" href="https://stachlab.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Stachowicz lab</a> at Bodega Marie Laboratory, UC-Davis. 

> pre science

I am originally from Mülheim an der Ruhr in NRW, Germany, where I went to Gymnasium Broich. A high-school exchange from 2002 - 2003 in West Palm Beach (Fl, USA), where I took a Marine Biology class with Mr. Marshall, reinforced my decision to become a scientist!
