Hi! :wave:

<br>
<br>

I am an evolutionary ecologist studying variation within and across species to understand the drivers of phenotypic diversification. This website is mostly about my science, but I also use it compile and communicate techy stuff that I find interesting or useful. Feel free to look around and <a id="link" href="mailto:{{ site.author.email | encode_email }}"> drop me a line </a> if you'd like to have a chat.
